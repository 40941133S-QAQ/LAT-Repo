中文摘要：
教授宣布要開始進入作業階段，提醒學生按時上傳作業，不然會有扣分的情況。有兩位同學沒有上傳作業，教授請學生提醒他們確認是否已退選，否則會影響整學期的表現。接下來課程會深入探討pandas套件，教授介紹了一個練習平台OK Google，可以參加資料競賽並賺取獎金。

英文翻譯：
The professor announced that they would enter the homework phase and reminded students to submit their assignments on time or they would face a deduction in their grades. There were two students who failed to submit their assignments, and the professor asked their classmates to remind them to confirm if they had dropped out, or it would affect their performance for the whole semester. They would delve deeper into the use of the pandas package in the next lesson, and the professor introduced a practice platform called OK Google, where they can participate in data competitions and earn bonuses.The topic of income is often discussed because everyone wants to learn skills that can make their future life secure. However, it is a broad and abstract topic, so beginners should break down the big question into smaller ones and practice converting those into logical code. This helps to develop critical thinking skills and the ability to turn ideas into action. To do this, we need to combine our thinking with action by using programming as a tool. Computers have unlimited memory and can perform actions that humans cannot, so programming is a powerful tool for solving complex problems. However, it is important to have fundamental knowledge and the ability to distinguish between accurate and inaccurate information in order to use programming effectively.In this dataset, the first question is how many men and women there are, and the second question is what is the average age range of the women. It is possible to ask if the age range for men is the same as for women. Another question is how many people live in Germany and are German citizens. Additionally, one can ask about educational levels and how they relate to income and ethnicity. One can also ask about the marital status and work hours of individuals who earn over 50k. Finally, there can be questions about work hours and salary in different countries and cultures. The ability to interpret the data is important in order to write effective programming questions. The dataset can be found on the original website, and it is important to analyze the data to gain insights beyond just the numbers.The difficulty of providing a traditional Chinese summary versus an English translation may vary. Even with the same data, there may be some tricky parts if it is not properly organized. If you lack confidence in your programming skills, it is recommended to start with the organized data. The website UCI provides a lot of well-organized data sets, which is good for practicing different types of data. The data is open to the public because it is from English-speaking countries. If you want to provide Chinese data, it may not be accepted, so it is suggested to stick to English data. After opening the desired data set, you can see that there are several different tables available to use. Remember to save the file as a CSV file to properly use Pandas. If you encounter any problems, you can interact with the program for guidance.Summary:
The text discusses a conversation between two individuals regarding data analysis. They discuss the process of naming columns in a table and how to retrieve data from a website. The importance of being able to interpret and understand programming language is emphasized.

Translation:
The numbers 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 are being discussed, and the conversation turns to a website called Ok Go that provides data descriptions. The first column is missing, and the third column contains descriptions of h o case and snl wgt. The person being spoken to helps with naming these columns, and the website is checked for more information. The suggestion is made to purchase data, and then the conversation turns to the importance of being able to interpret programming language. The conversation turns to how to name a table, and the importance of having a basic understanding of programming is highlighted.

The person being spoken to helps read a file, and the conversation eventually turns to discussing the relationship between work hours and salary in different countries. The importance of being able to interpret programming language is again emphasized, as well as the need to be able to read and understand technical documentation.可能沒有認真過，你這時候前後文大概差一下，你會去查字典查不認識的字，所以學習狀態去跟程式語言互動。教學方法不是逐一介紹每個單字，而是用情境營造及已知詞彙進行溝通，有工具可以客製化自己的學習方式。教學方式有專有名字"tinkering"意思是敲敲打打，允許在安全環境下嘗試錯誤。老師類似救生員只要不出人命、不搞爆炸，就讓學生自己建構連結而不是步驟跟隨。對象從動物到骨拜都能綁在一起做運算，例子呈現對物種奔跑速度求平均的方法。Summary in Traditional Chinese:

這段文字講述了一個 chatbot 要聚合哪些資料，以及如何計算出不同國家的平均工時和薪資。Chatbot 分成兩個階層的服務，在不同國家的高收入工作時數和薪資調查中，他們發現南美洲某國平均工時最短、薪資最高。 Chatbot 的回答可以被用來進一步探討這個現象。

English Translation:

This text describes a chatbot aggregating data and calculating average work hours and salaries in different countries. The chatbot offers two-tiered services, and in its investigation of high-paying jobs in various countries, it discovers a country in South America with the shortest average work hours and highest salaries. The chatbot's response can be used to further investigate this phenomenon. The text emphasizes the importance of using programming as a tool to find answers and solve problems, and encourages users to integrate coding into their daily lives.你，因為我而改變了一種學習態度。學習是一種開心的事情，你覺得自己變聰明、有自信是一個開心的事情。你未來工作很好，然後回頭告訴我說，我當您告訴你的事情超級有用，我就覺得很有成就感，我要的是種東西。所以你好我就好了，那我也希望你生活過得好嗎？我不會用那種比較逼迫手段，因為我只能告訴你說這世界就是這麼大，有這麼多機會，他要的人才長什麼樣子，但是你選擇怎麼過生活，還是最後在你身上做決定，我不會比你更糟，吃你的人生啊，但是身為一個老師的責任就是我該說的要說，你能聽多少就是我們的緣份。你不能接受，我也不能怎麼樣啊，所以接下來的作業就是這個，你要找一組自己有興趣的資料，一定要是自己有興趣啊，千萬不要適應付，拜託你們。你要應付別怕，我沒有沒有任何意見，可是我已經這麼認真在營造，讓你們自己去看所的氛圍，請你們找自己有興趣的，而且我更希望是你上來講的時候眼睛發光的話，你好奇的事情透過這些工具，你又知道了更多，然後你提了10個問題之後跟卻的確的互動。在從panda的官方文件去確認確的就給你的程式碼是不是真的可以用轉回自己的程式嗎？以後去找出自己對這個資料之後所看到的動了，你們現在的時間呢，就是有兩條路一條能就是你還真的不知道在幹嘛，沒關係，你就用我剛剛的整個範例流程法拿實體做完，但是不能變成作業單純就是課堂上的練習，我在這裡陪你，如果你已經完全知道正路是什麼，現在要離開早就舒服地方開始寫作業應就就離開，OK嗎？所以我現在時間就是我已經講完是犯了就好像游泳做做暖身示範就開始有啊，就是你的上體育課老師講3小時怎麼打籃球，不老師示範完你們就真的去比賽一場，你就真的在打籃球，這個才是真正的學成。他就開始各自行動吧，那我們今天的任務英交代完畢要交的東西講完了，該怎麼查資料也講了，所以剩下就是你們自己去探索囉。
